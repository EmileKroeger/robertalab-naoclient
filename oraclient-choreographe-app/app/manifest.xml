  <description lang="en_US">NAO connects automatically to the Open Roberta Lab to receive and execute user programs developed in NEPO programming language.

&lt;h3>How it works&lt;h3>
This app is working in the background. Each time you start NAO the Open Roberta Lab Connector sends it token to the Open Roberta Lab and waits for a user program, provided by the Open Roberta Lab Server to execute it immediately.
The token consists of the last 8 characters of the MAC address. Please press one of  NAO's head sensors and he will spell the token for you.
Once you now the token, go to the &lt;a href="https://lab.open-roberta.org" target="_blank">Open Roberta Lab&lt;/a>, choose NAO as your system, click on the robot's icon in the menu, choose »connect ...« and type in the token in the token field. After confirming the input with a click on »OK« your NAO is connected to the Open Roberta Lab

Now you can start developing programs with NEPO and execute them immediately on NAO.

Have fun programming your NAO with NEPO in the Open Roberta Lab :-)
